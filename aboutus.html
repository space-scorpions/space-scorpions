<center><h1>About Us</h1></center>
<center><h4>We are a team of 5 that met through frc robotic team. Verda, İlke, Batu,Çınar and Berkin. We chose this challenge due to our passion for moon and data visualization. We have worked vigorously and applied all of our skills to complete this challenge. These skills include basic 3D modeling, video editing and data visualization. limited time and inability to work together made it difficult for us to but we pulled through and overcame the obstacles. We would like to thank our parents and mentors for giving us this opportunity. This has been a very enjoyable and educating experience for all of us. <br> <br> Scorpions #7672 is a robotics team founded in 2017 by high school students. Apart from its robotic activities, it maintains its active team identity by organizing various social responsibility projects and activities. In this space app team which we created this year, our goal is to expand our vision and create a visual map of the earthquakes on the moon.</h4></center>
